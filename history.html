    <p>Bratislava, the capital of Slovakia, is the largest city in the country.  It's long history began over 20 million years ago, where some of the earliest human bones have been found.  It started as a Roman military camp, and was granted town privileges in 1291.
    It has been populated by the Romans, Germans, Hungarians, and other Slavic peoples who have contributed to the many cultural traditions of the city.  Built, destroyed, and rebuilt again, the city offers a unique window into the past.</p>
